After clocking the 17th hour of working on my first YouTube video, I decided to
take a step back and began to question its value.

Before I go into the reason why I ultimately decided on blogging, I want to talk
about my thoughts about YouTube and content creation in general, explaining why
I want to do it in the first place.

## Why I Want To Do YouTube

First, let's get into the **why**, because it drives all the other decisions.

Right away, I want to disregard two potential reasons: Money and Marketing for
my game.

It requires naivety, if not ignorance, to think that I could succeed in YouTube
or game development, when splitting my focus between them, given the competitive
nature of those fields. I want to primarily focus on making my own games, which
leaves not enough room for another bottomless time-sink.

It reminded me of the wisdom of everyone's favorite human grumpy cat:

![Quoting Ron Swanson from the show Parks and Recreation.
'Never half-arse two things, whole-arse one thing'.](./ronswanson.jpg)

It makes no sense for me to do YouTube for any reason that requires many views,
because it highly correlates with the amount of time I have to put in, time that
I would rather directly put into the game. I do **not** want to become a
full-time YouTuber, but fully focus on my own video games instead.

This realization comes with a liberation: If I don't need views, I don't have to
please the almighty, ever-changing algorithm. I can focus solely on the content,
without any padding for mid-roll ads, spending dozens of hours on overly edited
videos to increase retention, resorting to clickbait or selling out to sponsors.

### Doing YouTube As A Hobby

It makes more sense to treat YouTube as a hobby, just for fun. The urge to share
opinions, to seek validation and to belong to a community, makes people post on
social media in the first place. YouTube as a medium has the potential to make
the content timeless, compared to an almost ephemeral tweet, which no one will
see again once it leaves the timeline. Well, at least if we ignore the platform
ownership issue.

It already seemed impossible to find people in "real life" who share a common
interest in tech or other nerd stuff, but since I started working from
home, the opportunities became even rarer. Posting about my interests scratches
this itch somewhat. I can share my passion and potentially connect with
like-minded people.

Running a YouTube channel also makes you learn useful skills, that can apply
outside of the platform:

- gaining confidence in front of a camera
- improving script writing and storytelling
- getting valuable constructive feedback from others
- diving deeply into a specific topic

This sounds fun!

### YouTube As Creative Outlet

YouTube can also feel cathartic, helping me with exploring my feelings and
thoughts. I already write down all my thoughts in local Markdown documents, but
YouTube videos could turn them into something more organized. Audio and visuals
can enrich the content as well.

Presenting a topic to someone else makes sure that you understand the topic in
the first place. If my topic covers my personal thoughts and opinions, YouTube
becomes a great tool to reflect on them, and I might even gain new insights from
this process. For example, helping me decide whether creating YouTube
devlogs make sense for me ;)

Documenting the journey of me trying to make my own game allows me to essentially
travel back in time later, to remind myself of why and how I decided to
do certain things, and to keep track of the challenges along the way.

### Building Authority Through YouTube

For better or worse, YouTube can help to gain some sort of authority. This could
potentially open up some opportunities.

For example, I can just use my YouTube channel as an excuse to slide into the
direct messages of a developer to ask them questions. "Hey, I run MyCoolChannel,
and want to make a video about you and your game. Could you help me with some
questions that I have?" will make them more likely respond than a tweet by a
random bloke, bothering them with a bunch of questions.

## Why I DON'T Want To Do YouTube

To fully realize whether YouTube makes sense for me, I must also take a look at
the reasons for **not** doing YouTube. As mentioned above, time does not really
concern me, since I don't aim to get any views, I can invest as little time as I
want.

### Lack Of Ownership

Building something on land that you don't own means that you never truly own it.
This also applies to YouTube, where not just my channel, but the whole platform
could disappear overnight.

One of the mentioned reasons *for* doing YouTube, the documentation of my
journey, conflicts with the lack of ownership. A platform that might change its
terms and services prevents the preservation of the content. This might not
happen soon, but in a span of 10, 20 years, it becomes almost unavoidable.

YouTube likes ads, which started their war with ad blockers. Imagine a future
where YouTube wins the war, forcing minutes of ads in every video. For someone
like me who does not see YouTube as a viable income source, it will only degrade
the quality of my videos with the forced ads.

### Influence Of Analytics

Basic human psychology makes us repeat things that get positive feedback, and
avoid the things that bring us negative feedback. This means that YouTube could
easily bleed into the creation of the videos and even my games.

Polished visuals will result in better views than placeholder programmer art,
but the natural order in game development defers polishing for as long as
possible. Polishing stuff that might get thrown out will mean that I wasted my
time in the worst case.

This applies not just to the visuals, but also to the actual video topics, and
even code of the game. A "cool" algorithm makes a better video than just me
talking about how I refactored my code. I might even end up focusing on shipping
features instead of writing maintainable code, just to get the content for the
video out on time.

I don't care about views right now, but because of the  feedback through
analytics, I worry that my focus will shift indirectly towards views over time,
even if it happens subconsciously. Even worse than that, I could easily see
myself getting stressed out during the later stages of development, and having
YouTube tell me that people started to "hate" my videos might break the final
straw for me, burning me out.

I could just not look at the analytics at all, but when I tried to do exactly that
earlier this year, when [I streamed game dev on Twitch for 2
weeks](https://sullygnome.com/channel/genusnymphicus/365), I realized that I
still occasionally took a peek in a moment of weakness. YouTube gets even more
in-your-face with the metrics, and places them all over the creator dashboard.

This blog doesn't have any analytics for this reason. Analytics help with
creating an actual commercial product, because views and behavior matter, but
for a blog that I just create for fun, the can turn the "fun" quickly into
"side business".

### Immutability Of Videos

Once you upload a video, you can't change it anymore. Well, in theory you could
take it down, do the changes, and then re-upload it, but not only will you annoy
subscribers, re-editing, rendering and uploading the video also takes hours,
which makes it unsuitable for quick edits.

This means that factual errors would keep spreading. It also means I can't
update the content with new data, let's say adding the first week's sales data
to the postmortem of my game. Maybe a few viewers add great points that I would
want to highlight in the video, etc.

This also affects educational videos the most: Instead of updating the video
when a programming library API changes, I would need to upload an entirely new
video.

## The Alternatives To YouTube

Alternatives to YouTube, that can mitigate some of the disadvantages, exist.

### Streaming

I already briefly mentioned streaming. While it doesn't scratch the creative itch,
it also doesn't take any extra time to do. When I streamed earlier this year, I
did while programming on my game. It didn't take long to have my
first regulars, with whom I talked about our shared interests.
Whenever I got a new follower, I used that opportunity to talk about their
projects. Unfortunately, I had to stop streaming before it got any traction due
to personal issues.

The option to return to streaming has opened up again, but currently, I feel not
sure anymore. Getting into *the zone* seems impossible while streaming. Talking
through what I worked on didn't distract me directly, as I often just verbalized
my inner thoughts. Unfortunately, smaller distractions, like glancing at the
chat or thoughts about the stream itself, questions like "Does this feel
boring?", created enough interruptions to keep me from losing myself in my work.
The live aspect surely didn't help, because I focused on not doing anything
off-putting, like flashing my bum, picking my nose, or browsing social media.

Having barely any experience with streaming contributed probably to this a lot,
and routine and familiarity might avoid this somewhat.

One potential solution could involve limiting streaming time and completing the
majority of the work off-stream, but I don't think I would gain anything this
way, over just creating videos.

### Blogging

Honestly, blogging didn't cross my mind at all at first. Not sure why, but
blogging as a whole seem not nearly as popular anymore, compared to 10-20 years
ago.

When I [r/NewTubers](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewTubers/), to read
up on the whole How-To YouTube stuff, one post in particular stood out to me:
[YouTube isn't the only
way](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewTubers/comments/1eqnxdm/youtube_isnt_the_only_way/),
by Chris Zukowski, who has one of the most popular game development blogs: [How
To Market A Game](https://howtomarketagame.com/), where he talks about the
marketing side of things.

While he aims his advice towards people who struggle with YouTube for years,
encouraging them to give blogging a try, it got me thinking: My reasons
for doing YouTube also apply to a classic blog. Blogs also don't have any of the
mentioned drawbacks, unless I pick any of the proprietary blogging platforms.

At first, I thought that the debate would shift to video vs text content, but I
don't think that this makes a lot of sense. I can just pick the medium that fits
best and just self-host it on my blog. I can easily embed a video on my website,
if I really wanted to.

Having "plain text" as a viable option opens up many advantages. Updating and
storing text files requires minimal effort, and they offer greater portability,
allowing me to create them almost anywhere. I can sit down and write without
dressing up, anywhere where I want, even in a noisy environment. Since text
works nicely with version control systems, preservation becomes really simple.

YouTube offers reach, and the ability to bring organic traffic through the
algorithm. Since I don't really care about the viewer count,
YouTube loses its biggest strength as a platform.

## Conclusion

Turns out that no compelling reasons push me to use YouTube, as a simple blog
can achieve the same goals, while offering some advantages. Owning the platform
fully, avoiding the trap of status-seeking, and maintaining complete flexibility
and independence, all while saving time, provide strong incentives. Given that I
only want to produce content to still my creative urge, document my progress,
and organize my thoughts, I don't see any reason to get distracted by YouTube.

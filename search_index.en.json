I ain't got no time, dood!\"\nI hear you. The actual article contains examples and more details, but here is the summary.\n\nIntro\nOne day, when I was reluctantly hacking on a web crawler in the Unity game\nengine for some contract work, I turned on some programming stream for some background noise, since\nremote work can feel pretty lonely at times.\nI picked some random streamer because he was rocking a minimalistic Linux setup using Neovim,\nsimilar to my own. By sheer coincidence, he was just starting his \"Teaching Rust to total\nBeginners\" stream. However, it didn't take long for his enthusiasm for the language and certain features\nto distract me from my work.\nEveryone knows about the Rust Evangelism Strikeforce. Overly zealous Rust\nprogrammers, who spread the word of their lord and savior to an almost annoying extent.\nThis was different. He was enthusiastic about the language, but actually showed the neat little\nthings the language has to offer, beyond just throwing around keywords I didn't care about.\nWho cares about non-saying things like correctness or safety?\nIt's not like they don't matter, but so far I could manage without them just fine.\nIt's not like a small wannabe game developer like me really cares so much\nabout the common buzzwords around Rust. To be completely honest, I am sure there were\nsome feelings of spite towards this \"cult\" that just made me not look into the language further, beyond superficially DuckDuckGoing some sample code and calling it verbose or hideous(I mainly blame lifetimes for that). I feel like you only really start to appreciate these keywords once you experienced them firsthand, at least I did.\nInstead, this bearded man talked about enums in combination with pattern matching,\nhow there is no null and no inheritance, almost everything is an expression, all the countless quality of life features, modern tools, practical macros and functions for iterators and containers.\nHow error messages are actually readable, but more than that, they are actually helpful!\nAll that without sacrificing performance.\nSorry Mr. Webcrawler, you have to wait, I am being converted right now!\nI didn't expect this random streamer to be the impulse that made me procrastinate\nfor over a year on my personal projects, to learn this supposed to be a \"fad\" of a programming\nlanguage. Thank you ToggleBit for introducing\nme to Rust :)\nNow, after a little bit over a year of learning, I decided to share my experience and thoughts\nabout Rust, expressing my love for this language, but also trying to balance it by\ntalking about its issues. This seemed to be a reasonable entry topic for this\nnew blog.\nLet's start with the good things.\nThe Good\nI always feel that reducing Rust to its safety aspect is doing the language a\ndisservice. While safety might be important for big corporations, a small-time\ngame developer like me doesn't really care about it. For me, Rust is so much more than just safety.\nHere are my favorite things about Rust.\nRust Does Not Crash\nOkay, this is an exaggeration, but it is somewhat true, especially for safe Rust.\nThe truth is probably closer that Rust gives me a huge amount of confidence.\nWhen it compiles, it generally works.\nIt won't protect you from all kinds of logic errors, but it prevents a whole class of errors\nfrom happening and turns many into compile time rather than runtime ones.\nI admit, when I first started with Rust, correctness was not really a big concern.\nThe program should run of course, but crashing or bugs are not the end of the world most\nof the time, especially when it comes to games. They just happen.\nHowever, correctness is something that I really started to appreciate after using\nRust for a while. It really grew on me to a point where I don't want to miss it\nanymore.\nThe strong type system in addition to the ownership and lifetime rules just\nget rid of an entire class of runtime errors. There is no null, hidden implicit conversions,\nuse after free or move, or shared mutable state, at least for the most part.\nErrors can often even be recognized almost right after writing a line of code, because they don't pass the compiler.\nRustAnalyzer is also doing an amazing job here. This is a huge productivity boost.\nThis is by no means unique to Rust and you get something similar in any modern\nIDE for most relevant languages. The big difference is that Rust's strict rules,\nbe it ownership or type safety, just catches a lot more, to a point where it's\nrare to not get suspicious when it compiles without any complaints.\nRust also forces you to handle all code paths. You have to be explicit about things\nthat can fail. A function doesn't just randomly throw some exception when something goes\nwrong. Instead, it returns a Result that the caller has to check for errors and\nhandle them, or it returns an Option if there might not be a return value at all.\nYou just can't accidentally call a function on a \"null\" object. Part of the type\nsafety is that null is not a valid state. A value might be optional, but then Rust\nforces you to deal with both cases.\nPanic exists, but there is always a non-panicking alternative.\nInstead of indexing a slice that might be out of bounds, you can call\nmy_slice.get(index). Instead of foo.unwrap(), you just handle the Result,\netc.\n\nOn the first glance this seems more verbose, but in reality, the code to\nhandle this is something that should be probably written all the time in other languages, often ending up with even more verbosity.\nThe difference is that Rust forces you to write it, while in other languages,\nyou often end up procrastinating and might even ignore or forget about the\nnon-optimal paths.\nSince Rust expects you to deal with these cases, it has quality of life features to\nmake this easier(like the ?-operator).\nJust to clarify, panicking is not inherently bad.\nSome people might want to crash for severe logic errors in the code right away, to prevent some bigger problems.\nMy main point is that panicking is opt-in. It's a conscious decision. Not\nsomething that just happens because you forgot to deal with potential errors.\nI am certain that this changes how programmers deal with error handling in general. When you have to do\nsomething with the error anyway, be it handling it or just crashing, most will\nautomatically pick the choice that provides the better experience.\nThe side-effect is that the program ends up being more correct, because the potential\nerror cases are explicit. Nothing just silently fails or\nis null.\nEven the Rust community itself has a strong sense of correctness and soundness, which\nyou will notice in third party crates, but also in the tools. Rustacians\nactually keep asking for idiomatic solutions to a point where the term\n\"idiomatic Rust\" has almost become a meme, but that is another point.\nThen there are the unsafe blocks. They stick out like a sore thumb and\nautomatically attract special attention, especially when something actually goes\nwrong. Luckily, they are not throwing all of Rust guarantees out of the window, which\nmake them still safer than other languages, but this is the world of FFI (calling C code, or code that can expose a C ABI), pointer dereferencing, and messing with mutable static variables among a few other things.\nThe usual suspects you want to look at when something goes really wrong.\nSeparating these bad boys from the rest does not only reduce the cognitive\noverhead when working inside these blocks, but it makes finding the causes for\nissues much easier. They are usually as small as they can be, and often\nusually sit inside safe wrappers.\nRust is Modern\nAfter treading through the hell that is CMake or \"manually traversing transient dependencies in NuGet to hunt for standard 2.0 versions because of Unity\", Cargo, Rust's package manager and build tool, was a change. Turns out, adding dependencies can actually be easy.\nNot just dependency management, but also building for various platforms,\ncross compiling from Linux to Windows or even to WebAssembly is straightforward.\nBut Cargo is not where Rust stops. Documentation, linting, formatting, LSP integration, are\namong the best from the languages that I have used so far.\nClippy, Rust's linter, really helps to simplify code, making it more idiomatic, and also educates the user with links that\nexplain the rationale behind the suggestions. I even opt-in for a stricter set of\nwarnings, because it is that helpful.\nRust-analyzer, an implementation of the Language Server Protocol, has countless code actions and makes navigation work like a charm. Some really amazing people keep diligently working on it to a point, where I always look forward to the update every Monday. There are far more code actions than one could remember. From inlining functions, to expanding macros or inserting raw JSON - just looking at the options it provides is always a surprise.\nThere are many more helpful tools for testing, benchmarking, profiling, an\ninterpreter that detects undefined behavior(miri) and much more.\nAnd the best of all, most of them are pretty much the de facto standard in Rust. Not\nonly do they work really well together, but since most of them essentially come with Rust, or are at least expected to be used, they increase the baseline quality of the code in general. Library maintainers are for example expected to fix at least the default clippy lints.\nBut it's not just the tools, there are also many quality of life features in the language itself.\nSo many little handy helpers that you would not even expect from a high level language.\nHelpful macros that can embed bytes directly into the binary(useful for\nassets in small games, like game jam entries), formatting strings, things that deal\nwith boilerplate like derives and the mentioned ?-operator for bubbling up errors.\nBut my favorite are the iterators. There are just so many useful helper\nfunctions that make things easier to read and maintain. For example, to flip an image, that is to make the origin bottom left instead of top\nleft, is as easy as:\n\nAnd this comes without additional costs. \"Zero cost abstractions\" often\nsounds misleading, but iterators are generally at least as fast as\nmanually writing for-loops. flatten() and its friends are probably my\nfavorite, turning nested \"arrays\" into a single flat one.\nSo, when I am not sure how I want to do something, I skim through the\nIterator docs and almost always find some new useful little helper. The same is true for containers and even basic types.\nThe actual useful error messages and lack of legacy luggage(for now) are the cherry on\ntop.\nRust Supports My Laziness\nI am lazy, but I would argue this is true for most programmers.\nCode would be much safer and easier to maintain if everyone\nwould be const correct, pay attention to the critical sections, write tests,\nwouldn't go for low effort hacks, properly handle errors and would actually use proper tools.\nFrom my experience, programmers in general tend to go the path of least\nresistance.\nEven a super diligent and enthusiastic programmer will get tired. Some after years of bending to unreasonable client requests, like a web crawler in a fricking game engine, while for\nothers the lunch break is enough to reach their breaking point.\nThis is why defaults are impactful.\n\"More work to do the better thing\" often just turns into\nprocrastination. \"I do it once I am done\", but then often just forgotten or a seemingly more important thing,\nneeds to be done first. It's not just shared mutable state, but also unsafe hacks, or disabling the warnings, that are generally more work in Rust.\nSome things that are universally bad are even forbidden. You just can't\nhave uninitialized values or forget handling the error case.\nI hate riding the \"Rust good, C++ bad\" train. I'm picking on it because it is just the language I'm most\nfamiliar with, not because I dislike it or anything, I like it as much any other C++\nprogrammer who has a love-hate relationship with it. However, having switch cases be\nfallthrough, auto generated functions you often want to manually\ndelete(copy/assignment), non-destructive move, unsafe, mutable variables in general,\nor unchecked indexing in arrays, be the default, feels just wrong and often\ncauses issues.\nHeck, it's not even a problem exclusive to C++ or new/intermediate devs, but even experienced\nprogrammers in other languages suffer from bad defaults. A couple months ago, there was a tweet by a C veteran who worked decades for companies like Valve, Oculus and Intel:\n\nThe replies mentioned how -Wimplicit-fallthrough, would have caught it right\naway or depending on the compiler, it might have been part of -Wall, -Wextra,\netc.(not sharing the rest of this tweet chain, cause the discussion kinda\nwent south after the suggestions). The point is, that even industry veterans are\nsitting there, missing things that should/could have been the default. Wasting\nthree days on something that not just Rust, but useful defaults in general, would just have prevented.\nWhy do programmers need to opt-in to -Wall and friends in the first place? And why would they even spit\nout warnings for system headers? I get that some warnings might be\nsubjective or report false positives, nothing wrong with those being optional, but an uninitialized value, the classic\nif (a = b) {}, wrong format character in printf, or even wrongly formatted inline ifs, are objectively bad.\nThere is no reason to not check for them by default, at least in debug builds.\nWarnings being opt-in just means that the people who care about them will be\nflooded with warnings for the code they didn't write and just end up missing the warning they care about.. defeating their whole purpose. Rust goes even a step further and makes you \"hardcode\" the lints that should be followed on a crate or module level, and opt-in to the exceptions for those lints on a case-by-case basis.\nPeople who need the objectively \"worse\", rare or unsafe/unchecked options should actually opt-in to them, rather than making the \"better\" or safer option more work. Who cares if bounds checking is slower? Most of the time\nthe single bounds check is insignificant to the overall performance, and in the\ncases where it actually becomes a problem, you can opt-in to use the unchecked\nalternative, when you actually need it. The bonus point is, that you only have\nto be really careful in the few exceptions where you need it.\nAs mentioned, Rust generally follows the philosophy that the \"bad\" things are opt-in rather than opt-out, but it goes even a step further and its fundamental design turns\ncomplex solutions into a fight with the borrow checker. Especially when starting\nyou might think your solution is fine, it was fine in the language you used\nbefore, you know how to program, Rust is wrong.. But after embracing \"the style\nthat pleases the borrow checker\" and using Rust's uncommon language features(at\nleast uncommon when it comes to mainstream languages), I can admit that the borrow\nchecker is usually right, and the code ends up simpler and cleaner as a result. Turns\nout, it's easier to test and refactor when objects are not carrying mutable references\naround or are in complex graphs of relationships.\nOnce I was no longer fighting the borrow checker and saw him more as an adviser than\na hurdle, Rust became bliss.\nRust is opinionated, yes, but having an \"enforced\" standard with naming\nconventions and all, makes sure everyone writes the same code. It's super simple\nto read other people's code, because you are already familiar with the common\nidioms and naming conventions, and clippy will make sure the code is as simple\nand idiomatic as it should be.\n\nAll in all, I found Rust just incredible fun to write. The combination of\nmatches and enums, the flexibility of traits, the fact that almost everything is an expression, that\nthe tools actually got your back, errors are caught early or are even prevented\naltogether, and the impactful defaults make Rust just fun and kinda just makes\nyou strive for the idiomatic solution.\nHowever, not everything is great, not even in Rust. There are ugly things and\nthings that are not strictly good. So let's dive into those.\nThe (Potentially) Bad\nThe following things are not strictly bad. They are either necessary \"evils\" or highly\nsubjective. Most of them are even optional.\nRust Is Opinionated\nWhile I considered it a good thing above, and I think the net result is\ndefinitely positive, there are some arguably bad parts to Rusts opinions and\ndepending on personal preferences, they can weight differently.\nCompared to a language like C++, which pretty much follows the philosophy \"do\nwhatever you want, I don't care\", Rust can feel restrictive.\nThings like inheritance, function overloading or even default arguments are not supported by design.\nInheritance is replaced with composition. One could argue that composition is pretty much superior in all cases, but it generally leads to more boilerplate.\nYou often end up forwarding functions to the components, unless you want to(or can) make\nthem publicly accessible. That said, this is not an issue exclusive to\ncomposition, but also true for tuple structs in general(often used for the newtype\nidiom).\nHopefully, Rust will have some way to flatten fields at some point to increase\nthe ergonomics.\nFunction overloading can be somewhat replaced via trait implementations:\n\nIt works for many cases where the number of arguments is the same and the types\njust differ, but it requires importing the trait into scope. More complex cases\nrequire associated types(to have an \"arbitrary\" number of parameters) and are just\nnot possible cleanly, without involving some From-hacks and tuples.\nThe advantage is similar to Rust's alternative to traditional operator\noverloading, which also uses traits: Once you understand the purpose of the trait, you know what happens\ninside the function. There should be no hidden surprise.\nThere won't be some street tough who decides that % is a valid\noperator to overload for the vector cross product...\nDefault arguments and even overloading to some extent(especially for \"constructors\"), can be replaced via the builder pattern or just config structs.\n\nSo far, I haven't missed traditional overloading yet, even though that the lack of them leads to some weird automatically generated bindings, like this\ncomically humongous chunk of a fn in web-sys, which even used to break the formatting on docs.rs(scroll horizontally to take in the beauty in its entirety):\n\nThere are also strict style, versioning and naming guidelines, API references and more or less\nforced tools that tell you about the more \"idiomatic\" usage. You are free to stray away from the defaults, but be sure to face a huge backlash if you ever interact or share your code with others.\nThis is not necessarily a bad thing. Coming from C++, where everyone and their\nmom uses their own conventions, subset of the language, and manage their own list of STL-thing to avoid or even re-implement.\nFrom \"C with operator overloading\" to template metaprogramming, \"modern C++ version XX\" ,traditional OOP and everything in between, it is actually a welcoming change to see similar code written in all projects. Maybe this is because Rust is still young and there are not many things that people are disagreeing with yet. The biggest debate I have seen so far is about whether to use mod.rs or the new foo.rs when it comes to submodules, \"foo\".to_string() vs \"foo\".into() vs \"foo\".to_owned() vs String::from(\"foo\"), and kebab-case vs snake_case for crate names, which are all pretty harmless in the grand scheme of things.\nSome people still have their preferences, like minimizing\ndependencies, no-panic-policies, or the reliance on generics, but they rarely affect the structure of the code. The overall code will still look pretty much the same.\nThough, there is also the argument to be made about whether Rust makes the aforementioned \"bad\" things, like shared mutable state, a bit too cumbersome for cases where you actually need them.\nRust Is Not Object Oriented\nThe biggest cultural clash for many is probably the fact that Rust is not\nobject-oriented. Well, it depends on what you consider object-orientation.\nThere is no clear definition(and some hoodlums might argue that this lack of\nclarity is the main issue with OOP in general), but some people reduce it to\nlanguage features like having the concept of \"classes\", as in bundling data and\nbehavior(with access modifiers), data inheritance and polymorphism, all of which exist in Rust to some\nextent. Structs are basically just classes, inheritance can be replaced with\ncomposition and polymorphism can be archived via enums, generics and trait\nobjects. So Rust offers object-oriented features from that point of view, and might\nbe considered object-oriented.\nHowever, if you look at it as actually orienting your code\naround objects and applying the GoF design patterns, following object-oriented\ndesign as it is commonly used and taught(having a bunch of \"is-a\" or \"has-as\"\nrelationships, because \"it makes sense for the nouns\"), it becomes more of a way\nto solve problems and organizing code than a set of language features.\nThis kind of OOP will cause you a hard time in Rust, no matter where you stand on the OOP debate.\nNo matter how you label the language or define the programming paradigms, Rust encourages grouping data based on purpose, ownership, lifetimes and the problems you want to solve.\nYou pass around \"references\" only when needed with the required mutability, store\nindices/ID's into flat containers, and use dedicated context objects, instead of storing direct\nreferences left and right. A reference is often only temporary.\nThe difference becomes especially clear in graph-like data structures, where the data needs to keep track of some sort of\nhierarchy. The \"Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists\"-book is a great resource for these kinds of problems.\nGenerally, I found shoving the entire data as a whole in a flat container(like a Vec)\nand then keeping track of their relationships via optional indices into that\ncontainer to be a great workaround, and I would argue that this even has some advantages\nover the classic approach.\nThe bottom line is, your enjoyment of Rust relies on whether you are willing to adapt and\npotentially ditch the way you did things in other languages, which is not necessarily\nlimited to OOP, but to whatever patterns and paradigms you are familiar with.\nRust is different.\nChasing Idiomatic Rust\nAs mentioned previously, \"idiomatic Rust\" is a very common phrase,\nespecially amongst beginners, to a point where it almost is a meme.\nWhen the language, ecosystem and the surrounding community \"share\" an opinion,\nyou might be afraid to just tackle the problem on your own, at least this was(and still is\nto some extent) true for me. Instead of just doing something, I waste time\nessentially bikeshedding, or researching \"idiomatic\" solutions. What should be\nexported in the lib.rs, what should be reachable via the submodules? foo/mod.rs vs\nfoo.rs as sibling of foo/? A single huge trait vs multiple smaller ones(that add\nthe noise of having to almost always import them all together)? How to organize assets in the repo for\nexamples and tests? Should crates in a workspace share a common prefix? Which\nClippy lints can I ignore?(especially when it comes to number casting and\n\"stuttering\" like texture::Data vs texture::TextureData, where the former is\nan import nuisance).\nRust is the first language that actually makes me search for the \"idiomatic\ntruth\" when being unsure, before I start to think about pros/cons on my own.\nWhile in other languages, it didn't really matter to me, since everyone\nhad their own guidelines.\nSure, I wasted a lot of time searching the forums, API guidelines and asking\nquestions(the community is incredibly helpful and seemingly loves to talk about\nbest practices), but the Result is that this definitely increased the base\nquality(at least in my code), but more importantly, reading, interacting with and using other people's code becomes pretty straight forward. There are far fewer inconsistencies.\nDependency Hell\nWithout a doubt, adding dependencies to a Rust project is as simple as writing\nthe name and version(or wild card) in your Cargo.toml. No need to resort to\nheaders-only libraries, copying the source files into your project,\nwriting/looking for CMake files(or FindPackage), or building\na separate project to build the binaries for an \"old\" version, so you don't have to crawl through\nNuGet manually to grab dependencies, because the game engine you are using\nforked the runtime which only supports .net standard 2.0 dependencies...\nA simple, unified dependency manager and build tool, that actually solves most problems, is definitely great, but also comes with some\ncaveats.\nSome might argue that this causes an over reliance on dependencies in the\ncommunity. A fairly low level graphics program using winit + wgpu can end up with 100-200 transient\ndependencies. This is just from running the hello-triangle example:\n\nIt's basically impossible to audit them all. There could be\nmalicious code or just incompatible licenses in any of them and you need to\ntrust that everyone in this chain at least vetted their direct\ndependencies. There are some movements and tools for \"trusted\" dependencies,\nlike cargo vet and general\ndependency validation(licenses, sources..) via cargo-deny, but the\nsituation is far from ideal. It's not close to npm-kinda-bad at least.\nThough, it's not like C++ is super transparent either, since dependencies often rely on system libraries and\npackages that are not immediately clear. Or things are commonly\nre-written from scratch, so you end up with a dozen different\nString-reimplementations or something in a single project.\nAnother issue is that the community itself tends to recommend existing crates\nto answer questions. \"How to do X?\" \"Here is crate Y\". While the intention might\nbe \"here is a crate that does what you want, you can take a look and see how they did it\",\nthe result seems to be that the crates are just taken as they are and added as dependency.\nThere is nothing wrong with using dependencies per se. They are often tested,\nmaintained by multiple people and can solve many problems in a timely manner.\nRust also goes a long way to solve many problems with additive features(and\nunification) and version compatibility to reduce them as much as it can.\nHowever, aside from the mentioned risks, dependencies are also not without a cost and are often the main reason for\none the biggest complaint that Rust gets: They increase the build times.\nThe error handling crate\nthiserror is the perfect example.\nIt's an incredibly handy crate and basically the de facto standard for writing\nerrors in libraries. And one of the crates(together with anyhow) recommended to beginners whenever\nthey ask about errors. But its dependency on proc-macro can add a few seconds to\nthe compile times(3-5 on my machine), just to save a few lines of boilerplate.\nBasically to write this:\n\ninstead of this:\n\nIs the thiserror solution much cleaner? Without a doubt, and this doesn't even touch\nits other useful features, especially all the different conversions it can\ngenerate automatically, which would result in much more boilerplate. Is it worth up to 5 seconds clean compile time? This is highly subjective, and especially for smaller crates I would argue no.\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not saying to avoid crates or thiserror in\ngeneral. If you already rely on proc-macro, thiserror is basically free. It\nalso doesn't really impact incremental build time nearly as much, and there are a bunch of\nhelpful features(automatically creating From conversions) that makes it more\nusable in bigger projects. I just wanted to illustrate the not so obvious cost of crates, that often offer\nonly marginal comfort.\nIt might just be a few more seconds, but I found that each extra second adds\nanother second where I might get potentially distracted(who just sits there waiting for the\nbuild to finish?), often losing track of what I was doing.\nAnother cost when it comes to dependencies is the size. Rust's binaries\nare notoriously bloated unless you strip them, especially the debug ones. It doesn't\nhelp that cargo caches aggressively, and you often end up with artifacts from\nprevious versions. cargo prune and cargo sweep are helpful tools to solve this issue, but my local workspace is multiple GB in size, despite the final bin being just a couple\nMB.\nThat said, one huge advantage of Rust's dependencies are the de facto standard crates.\nThings like log, and, especially but not exclusively for graphics programming, raw-window-handle. Small, bridging crates\nthat allow you to use and swap out whatever implementations you want in the\nexecutable, as long as they are implementing the traits. They add a nice layer of\nabstraction without requiring any additional effort.\nNot just the bridges, but also Serde, Nom, rand and many\nmore are widespread, and any relevant crate supports them(where\napplicable), often via optional feature-flags. They are like an extended std.\nThere are also some issues when it comes to name and typosquatting on crates.io,\nthe main crate repository for dependencies, and the lack of namespaces is also\nfrustrating(though the latter is currently being worked on).\nUltimately, you are in charge on how many dependencies you actually want to add.\nPersonally, I tend to only add the absolute necessary ones, but I \"waste\" time\nrewriting things from scratch as a result. This pretty much boils down to\npersonal preferences.\n\nSo those were some potentially bad things about Rust, or more accurately, \"necessary\nevils\". They are not strictly bad, and are more like a trade-off, especially\nsince most of them are optional or at the very least highly subjective.\nEspecially if you can't let go of your previous programming style, Rust could cause a lot of friction.\nOn the other hand, if you fully embrace the Rust way of doing things, everything will just flow nicely.\nFinally, let's go through the ugly things..\nThe Ugly\nAs much as I like Rust, there are unfortunately some really painful things.\nLack of maturity\nAs I mentioned before, Rust is opinionated, but whether the opinions are right or wrong\nis only something that time will tell. It is unlikely, but possible that the unified community\nmight be split because of a difference in opinions at some point, splitting the ecosystem as certain other language did.\nIt is also unknown whether Rusts runs into its own kind of dependency hell, or if core design decisions\nmight get in the way in projects built over a long period of time.\nThere is simply no history of gigantic software using Rust for a decade.\nThe lack of mature libraries is also a common complaint. Many crates just seem to be afraid\nof hitting the 1.0 milestone. There are many breaking changes and everything\nseems to be constantly changing. There is a lot of work in progress, but very\nfew crates that are actually production ready. Rust is fairly new.\nAnother issue caused by Rust's novelty is that there is a lack of jobs. I like\nRust, I want to work with Rust, but comparing the list of jobs with something like C++ is still disappointing, especially after filtering out scam-tech. Let alone when you want to work in a certain niche(game development) and/or work fully remotely.\nTime will solve this issue, especially since Rust has proven that it is here to stay. A\nlittle over a year ago, it looked far more uncertain, but with Rust having\nits roots now into many big tech companies, the Linux kernel and many drivers\nbeing re-written in Rust, it won't just\nfizzle out in a couple of years, so I expect(and hope) the job situation will work itself\nout. Unfortunately, right now it's still a desert.\nThe language itself also has some holes. Rust offers many useful features with its\nlifetimes, traits, and it's typesystem, but I am constantly hitting unstable\nfeatures or outright forbidden operations when trying to use them together in\ncertain contexts. GATs(generics on associated types) are now stable and were one of the things where you just wanted to try to use the existing language tools when you ran into a certain problem, only to be rejected by the compiler.\nOr you want to make a function constant(so it can be executed during compile time), only to be greeted by \"requires feature const_fn_floating_point_arithmetic\".\nThen you see some neat little iterator function in the docs, something like\nas_chunks or ways to get a slice from an iterator,\nonly to get a warning that it is an experimental feature.\nSome useful features are also missing. Be it generic specialization, proper\ncustom allocator support that goes beyond changing the global one(there is WIP\nthough on the std collections), there doesn't\nseem to be something like placement new(there used to be a feature, but it seems to be\nabandoned for the new placement by return\nRFC).\nStatic asserts(without some weird hacks), and variadic templates are also on my\nwishlist.\nAs mentioned before, Rust focuses on correctness. There are many tracking\nissues that seem to be stuck for years, because there is no agreement on a solution, or\nbecause it wouldn't work on some exotic platforms or due to a niche reason. It's\nquickly adding new features that people can agree on, but the difficult\nquestions seem to be stuck at times, with only an occasional bump being a lost\nsoul, asking for the current status. There are only so many skilled volunteers\nafter all, who can only work on so many things. That said, I definitely prefer this approach any\nday over rushing half-finished or faulty additions. So a little shout out to all\nthe amazing volunteers out there, who made Rust what it is!\nThe Borrow Checker Is Not Always Right\nAnother problem is, that things that should be possible in theory are not passing the borrow\nchecker.\nThis is not to be confused with \"fighting the borrow checker\" to please its\nstrict requirements, but more about the borrow checker actually being wrong or\nbeing unable to process the information.\nMost commonly it's something like a \"getter\", that keeps borrowing the\nowning struct. While fields borrow the struct only partially, functions will\nborrow the entire struct for the duration of the returned borrow.\n\nRead the next point for two workarounds for this particular issue :)\n Edit \n Actually, this \"limitation\" makes total sense. Rust is explicit where it matters\nand there is no way to express the partial borrow with the function signature.\nIt's unreasonable to expect programmers to peek inside the fn implementation\njust to confirm whether a partial borrow happens or not :)\n\nThanks /u/llogiq, for pointing this out!\nSee also\n  \nAnother common scenario are matches(and other diverging code paths) inside a function:\n\nThe immutable borrow of the field could in theory be released for None\nbranch, because it's not used inside of it, but instead re-borrow the field as\nmutable. However, the complainer, as it is right now, sees the borrow for the entirety\nof the match.\nThere is work in progress to lift the\nlimitations(Polonius), and the borrow checker will become smarter with time, but it can be a nuisance.\nRewrite it in Rust\nThis is arguably the most frustrating problem in my opinion.\nWhen starting a new project, I find myself trying out different\napproaches, just to see how it all works out. Rust often requires rewrites or\nchanges early, especially during the problem exploration or prototyping phase, which\nautomatically guides you towards a simple and clean foundation, and it is arguably one of its\nstrengths, but sometimes you encounter fundamental issues mid-development.\nChanges in the requirement, or just new knowledge about the problem space, can potentially break the entire architecture. You might be happy with the solution, and everything is working fine, but then you encounter a case\nwhere everything falls apart. I am sure this is something that just comes with\nexperience, and I encounter this not nearly as much anymore as I did when I was a few\nmonths into the language, but it can still be a brutal issue.\nImagine writing a graphics renderer. The graphics resources live on some sort of context\nobject and you return handles to the caller. You don't want to return a borrow\nnor the full ownership, because it makes storing and cleaning them up more of a\nhassle. A Handle(for all intents and purposes just an ID) is good enough and there is no ownership involved.\nWhen you want to actually change the resource, you call some sort of getter, to temporarily borrow the\nconcrete resource, apply the changes, then release the borrow again.\n\nAll working fine.\nThen you work through the implementation, adding meshes, render 3D objects, got\nsome fancy camera action going,\netc. ..but then you encounter a case where you need to deal with cross-resource\nreferences:\n\nThere seems to be no way to get a reference to the texture and pass it to the\nshader. In theory, it would be possible to use context.textures.get() and\ncontext.shaders.get_mut() for the partial borrow, but unfortunately the whole\ncontext abstracts the ugly side of OpenGL, Vulkan and other graphics\nabstractions away, so the only way to \"enforce\" the fields is through getters in\nthe context trait(excluding the approach with generic Wrapper and associated types on the Context\ntrait for brevity). This is basically where we accidentally run into one of the mentioned limitations, but it\ncould be any other issue.\nMaybe it is possible to pass the texture handle to the shader instead?\nNope, the shader can't turn the handle into a concrete texture without the\ncontext. This might sound like a case for good ol' Rc&lt;RefCell&gt;, but it would require a complete rewrite, potentially even abandoning the Handles in the first place.\nAnother way could be to expose this function on the context itself, instead of getting the\nresources one by one, we write an unified function on the context that returns\nboth at once, or just forwards the intended operation:\n\nGreat, this fixed the problem.. but now this one little exception sticks out\nfrom the rest. There might be even additional cases in the future, so it's better to\nmove all the functions to the context right now, just so they are consistent.\nAfter all, it would be a usability nightmare to find set_variable in the shader, but set_texture\nin the context, even though both should just update a value on the shader.\nThe other alternative, splitting the borrow into a \"double getter\" works better\nfor this example, but we could face an explosion of combinations with varying\nmutability and different fields.\nThis example is still fairly simple, and should be recognized early in development, but imagine a breaking issue like this potentially being layers deep, involving lifetimes and being in later stages in a project..\nAll it takes is an oversight or a sudden change in requirements that could blow\nup the existing solution. The borrow checker is not wrong in this case, but it\nstill gets in the way.\n\"Rewrite it in Rust\" from a whole different perspective.\nTo be fair, this is true in programming in general, but Rust is stricter and\nmore opinionated, so that easy hacks and workarounds are much, much, more work\nand sometimes impossible.\nNot just the restrictions, but also the explicitness can sieve through layers of\ncode. Maybe your struct needs to be annotated with a lifetime now, which then in\nturns goes all the way to the root of your program, touching multiple struct and\nfunction on the way.\nSync, object safety and async are all feeble and viral as well. They spread\nthrough your layers, but can break from one moment to another.\nYou start using the compiler errors as a todo list, working towards the solution, always getting new\nerrors while you work through the layers, just to arrive at the final error in\nyour core trait, only to realize that it lost its object safety and can't be made\ninto a trait object anymore.\nPerhaps there are some performance targets that can't be reached or platform limitations with\nthe current approach that would require changes, which then just snowball through the modules.\nAs I mentioned, I am sure that experience will help alleviate this issue,\nand good coding practices minimize the impact, ideally just limiting it\nto the affected modules, but there are always some unknown unknowns in a project.\nThe current solution might work fine on the current backend with OpenGL, but what about Vulkan? On a different platform like Wasm or the Nintendo Switch? Or just some fancy rendering technique in a game? Possibly just an\noversight in general, since we are just humans? In the worst case, it would require a new solution from scratch.\nSome may argue that this kind of strictness leads to overall cleaner code that\nis easier to maintain, I wouldn't disagree with that, but no one would want to rewrite large portions of their code, let alone close to release.. But also, how is the experience on a bigger scale?\nOr with something where the entire project is an iterative process,\nlike it is in game development, where features constantly change? Rust just\nforces you to deal with the unknown unknowns at seemingly arbitrary times and\ncould potentially throw you a wrench into your plans at any day.\nIt's not just the borrow checker, but also potential soundness issues,\nlike aliasing. One example of this, is the popular Macroquad crate where their\nergonomic intention, a static mutable context, is unsound and would require a\nrewrite to fix.\nThe silver lining is that I found Rust code incredibly easy to refactor.\nAside from the fact that Rust leads to a simpler design without complex\ndependency graphs, the compiler becomes essentially a todo-list that you just\nwork through to finish refactoring. That said, I am interested in how this all\nlooks in practice when I work on some bigger scale projects during my next year,\nwith more experience.\nSwitching To Other Languages Feels Off\nI know. This sounds like /r/rustjerk content, feel free to skip over\nthis part, but my point is not that Rust is superior, but more that it can causes changes in general, at least it did to me. Rust just does so many things differently.\nBeing conditioned to please the borrow checker will just change how you approach problems and write code in general.\nIt takes a lot of time to switch from the \"ownership and lifetime\" model to the\n\"Oprah handing out mutable references\"-style. The cost of the context switch is\nhuge.\nAs stated multiple times now, Rust is opinionated. It is nigh impossible to\ninternalize these opinions, move to a different language and not keep practicing them. Rust also learned from the mistakes of its predecessors and added a lot of modern fluff, which you don't want to miss anymore.\nCorrectness alone is something that might sound bland on paper, but once\nexperienced it, it's something you don't really want to program without. Random segfaults or exceptions\nare a test of patience. Dealing with the silly defaults and different programming style/conventions is just tedious.\nIt's soul crushing to see a perfect fit for some iterator-fu or simple enum matching, but then having to rely on doing it\nmanually in a more verbose and error-prone way, or run into errors where the\ncompiler would have had your back.\nIt takes away a lot of the fun when you suddenly have to switch to another language.\nBut it's not just about fun, but also the cost you pay for context switching. Going back\nfrom/to Rust always took me a while to get used to it to hit my usual\nproductivity levels. This wasn't nearly as much of a problem when I was switching between C++ and C#.\nThis was a hurdle since I was/am relying on contract work, though now I am trying to work solely in Rust, so I might avoid this issue in the future.\n\nConclusion\nAll in all, even after weighing the cons, Rust just ticks the right boxes for me, and I am looking forward to where\nmy journey will take me. I just don't see myself writing code in another language in the\nforeseeable future.\nThanks for reading!\n\nAddendum\n\nThe user /u/ssokolow gives many interesting links and details to some of the\npoints mentioned in this article. I highly recommend checking it out!\n\nToo long, didn't read\nUnderstandable, here is a summary:\n Summary \n Intro\nSome bearded man on an internet streaming platform talked about the nice\nthings that Rust offered, that went beyond for me irrelevant buzzwords like \"safety\" or\n\"correctness\". While I started to really appreciate them after using\nRust for a while, enums with pattern matching, iterator-fu, the lack of null, the amazing tools and tons of quality of life features are what actually convinced me to take a closer look into the language.\n\n\nThe Good\n▪ Rust Does Not Crash: Rust encourages correctness and the\ncommunity embraces it. Praise for the strong type system and uniform error\nhandling!\n▪ Rust Is Modern: The tools are amazing and actually got your back. Lots of quality of life features in the language itself.\n▪ Rust Supports My Laziness: Impactful defaults and having the \"bad\" things being opt-in rather than opt-out are a huge game changer. When you are fighting the borrow checker, your solution is usually not as clean and simple as it could be.\n\nThe (potentially) Bad\n▪ Rust Is Opinionated:  Rust can feel restrictive at times. The alternative\nto common features in other languages often leads to more boilerplate. The plus side is\nthat everyone follows the guideline and tries to write (the same) idiomatic Rust.\n▪ Rust Is Not Object Oriented: Your enjoyment of Rust relies on\nwhether you are willing to adapt and potentially ditch the way you did things\nin other languages, which is not just limited to OOP. Rust is different.\n▪ Chasing Idiomatic Rust:  I notice how I waste(d) a lot of time\nchasing the idiomatic truth. When a language is opinionated like Rust, you\ndon't want to be the odd one out.\n▪ Dependency Hell: It's not uncommon to end up with hundreds of transient dependencies. This increases build times and risks, but there is also something like an extended standard library.\n\nThe Ugly\n▪ Lack Of Maturity:  Lack of jobs and mature libraries. Also still many\nunstable and unfinished language features.\n▪ The Borrow Checker Is Not Always Right:  The borrow checker is\nnot infallible. There are some limitations that you need to hack around.\n▪ Rewrite It In Rust: All it takes is a specific requirement\nor an unknown to break the entire architecture out of the blue. Trait objects, Sync, lifetimes,\nand async are all viral and feeble.\n▪ Switching To Other Languages Feels Off:  The borrow checker\nconditions you to write code in a specific way. Once you have embraced Rust's focus\non correctness and features, switching to another language is difficult.\n  \n","description":"My experience with Rust after a year of using it. The good, but also the bad things.","id":"https://breakbuild.games/blog/my-year-with-rust/","path":"/blog/my-year-with-rust/","title":"My Year With Rust: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly"},"https://breakbuild.games/blog/youtube-vs-blogging/":{"body":"After clocking the 17th hour of working on my first YouTube video, I decided to\ntake a step back and began to question its value.\nI want to talk about my thoughts on YouTube and content creation in general,\nexploring my reasons for doing it in the first place, and why I ultimately\nsettled on blogging.\nWhy I Want To Do YouTube\nAs a game developer, YouTube fascinates me.\nIt could become a career in itself, just a hobby for fun, a marketing device to\nsell a product or service, a self-improvement or feedback tool, a plain video\nstorage and sharing platform, a social medium and networking tool, or a\ncombination of these.\nFirst, I need to understand what I even want to get out of a YouTube channel,\nand how much I want to put in. This drives all the other decisions.\nRight away, I want to state that I don't want to pursue it for any monetary or\nmarketing reasons.\nThere seems to exist some sort of common misconception that devlogs would only\nappeal to other developers, but I don't agree with this. A devlog can appeal to\nwhomever it should appeal. Nothing prevents you from targeting a \"normal\" viewer\nwith high level devlogs. A demand comparable to all the crafting, building and\nengineering channels, just about game development instead, likely exists. Heck,\nI once watched a video about some dudes forging a sword. People just like\nwatching experienced people creating things, at least from a high level\nperspective, avoiding potentially boring technical details.\nThat said, it requires naivety to think that I could succeed on YouTube or in game\ndevelopment, when splitting my focus between them, given the competitive nature\nof those fields. Even the people who focus on a single thing full-time struggle\nto turn it into a viable business. I want to primarily focus on making my own\ngames, which leaves not enough room for another bottomless time-sink.\nIt reminded me of the wisdom of everyone's favorite human grumpy cat:\n\nIt makes no sense for me to do YouTube for any reason that requires many views,\nbecause it highly correlates with the amount of time I have to put in, time that\nI would rather directly put into the game. Maybe once my games become\nprofitable, I might consider spreading out, when I reach a state where I could\nhire someone to do this for me, but I remain somewhat doubtful about this.\nAt least for now, it makes more sense to make my game as good as possible, to\nincrease the odds of proper influencers picking it up. Even if I could magically\npull off a channel that gets one million views on their devlogs, this view count\nshould only amount to a fraction of the total views among all other influencers\nin the best case. Getting a channel with hundreds of thousands of subscribers to\nshowcase my game feels far easier than building a channel with a hundred\nthousand subscribers myself. Although the audience of my own channel might\ndisplay greater loyalty and convert better, one big influencer picking up my\ngame could create a snowball effect, leading to even more exposure.\nThis realization comes with a sense of liberation: If I don't need views, I\ndon't have to please the almighty, ever-changing algorithm. I can focus solely\non the content, without any padding for mid-roll ads, spending dozens of hours\non overly edited videos to increase retention, resorting to clickbait or selling\nout to sponsors. I can also talk about whatever I want, without having to appeal\nto a broad audience.\nDoing YouTube As A Hobby\nIt makes more sense for me, to treat YouTube as a hobby, just for fun. The urge\nto share opinions, to seek validation and to belong to a community, makes people\npost on social media in the first place. YouTube as a medium has the potential\nto make the content timeless, compared to an almost ephemeral tweet, which no\none will see again once it leaves the timeline. Well, at least if we ignore the\nplatform ownership issue, but more about that later.\nIt already seemed impossible to find people in \"real life\" who share a common\ninterest in tech or other nerd stuff, but since I started working from\nhome, the opportunities became even rarer. Posting about my interests scratches\nthis itch somewhat. I can share my passion and potentially connect with\nlike-minded people.\nRunning a YouTube channel also makes you learn useful skills, that can apply\noutside the platform:\n\ngaining confidence in front of a camera\nimproving script writing and storytelling\ngetting valuable constructive feedback from others\n\nThis sounds fun!\nYouTube As Creative Outlet\nYouTube can also feel cathartic, helping me with exploring my feelings and\nthoughts. I already write down all my thoughts in local Markdown documents, but\nYouTube videos could turn them into something more organized. Audio and visuals\ncan enrich the content as well.\nPresenting a topic to someone else ensures that you understand the topic in\nthe first place. If my topic covers my personal thoughts and opinions, YouTube\nbecomes a great tool to reflect on them, and I might even gain new insights from\nthis process. For example, helping me decide whether creating YouTube\ndevlogs make sense for me ;)\nDocumenting the journey of my attempt to make my own game allows me to\nessentially travel back in time later. I can remind myself of why and how I\ndecided to do certain things, get into the headspace at the time and to keep\ntrack of the challenges and solutions along the way.\nOpportunities Through YouTube\nYouTube can also help to open up many opportunities. You can connect with your\nfellow content creators or even collaborate with them. Your viewers might also\nwant to support you, either by contributing to the projects in different ways or\nby supporting you financially via Patreon.\nEven with a low subscriber count, a loyal following can provide early feedback\non a demo, or help to reach the 10-reviews threshold on Steam to get a rating, which\nin turn helps to kick off the organic traffic.\nI could also just use my YouTube channel as an excuse to slide into the direct\nmessages of a developer to ask them questions that interest me personally. \"Hey,\nI run MyCoolChannel, and want to make a video about you and your game. Could you\nhelp me with some questions that I have?\" will make them more likely to respond\nthan a tweet by a random bloke, bothering them with a bunch of questions. It\nmight even turn into a full interview.\nWhy I DON'T Want To Do YouTube\nTo fully realize whether YouTube makes sense for me, I must also take a look at\nthe reasons against it. As mentioned above, time does not really concern me,\nsince I don't aim to get many views, I can invest as little time as I want.\nTalking directly to the camera with minimal editing appears as the current\ntrend among developers who release their own games consistently and treat\nYouTube as a hobby. Managing this with 1-2 hours a week feels achievable.\nLack Of Ownership\nBuilding something on land that you don't own means that you never truly own it.\nThis also applies to YouTube, where not just my channel, but the whole platform\ncould disappear overnight.\nThis poses less of a problem for preservation, as I would probably create\nbackups for my videos, but the loss of subscribers would hurt me. Years of work\ncultivating a following that would just evaporate.\nYou can see this on Twitter: Many people tried to move to alternatives like\nMastodon or Bluesky, but only ended up with a fraction of the original engagement.\nYou also have no control over changes to the algorithm, the UI, or video content\nand format guidelines.\nInfluence Of Analytics\nBasic human psychology makes us repeat things that get positive feedback, and\navoid the things that bring us negative feedback. This means that YouTube could\neasily influence the creation of the videos and even my games.\nPolished visuals will result in better views than placeholder programmer art,\nbut the natural order in game development defers polishing for as long as\npossible. Polishing stuff that might get thrown out will mean that I wasted my\ntime in the worst case.\nThis applies not just to the visuals, but also to the actual video topics, and\neven code of the game. A \"cool\" algorithm makes a better video than just me\ntalking about how I refactored my code. I might even end up focusing on shipping\nfeatures instead of writing maintainable code, just to get the content for the\nvideo out on time.\nYouTube's algorithm disfavors technical niche content. A video about how I quit my\nlife as a vegan butcher to become a C++ programmer would get way more views than\na video on how to implement the Sutherland-Hodgman algorithm.\nI don't care about views right now, but because of the  feedback through\nanalytics, I worry that my focus will shift towards views over time,\neven if it happens subconsciously. Even worse than that, I could easily see\nmyself getting stressed out during the later stages of development, and having\nYouTube tell me that people also started to \"hate\" my videos might break the final\nstraw for me, affecting my mental health in unforeseeable ways.\nI could just not look at the analytics at all, but when I tried to do exactly that\nearlier this year, when I streamed game dev on Twitch for 2\nweeks, I realized that I\nstill occasionally took a peek in a moment of weakness. YouTube gets even more\nin-your-face with the metrics, and places them all over the creator dashboard.\nYouTube actually feels like an analytics trap, even when consuming content.\nBefore I watch a video, I look at the view count and subscribers. These metrics\ngive a false sense of authority. Given 2 tutorial videos, the one with a 100k\nviews will appear as more legit than the one with just 100.\nI keep telling myself that I don't care about the monetary aspects of devlogs,\nbut I often use Socialblade to see their view count\nover the past months and check whether the channels have a Patreon, to estimate\ntheir earnings. I often can catch myself thinking \"This channel makes $X with\nonly Y views! Hey, I could to that!\". This line of thinking  ignores the years\nof growth to reach that point, the opportunity costs, and won't get me closer to\nreleasing my games.\nImmutability Of Videos\nOnce you upload a video, you can't change it anymore. Well, in theory you could\ntake it down, do the changes, and then re-upload it, but not only will you annoy\nsubscribers, re-editing, rendering and uploading the video also takes hours,\nwhich makes it unsuitable for quick edits.\nThis means that factual errors would keep spreading. It also means I can't\nupdate the content with new data, let's say adding the first week's sales data\nto the postmortem of my game. Maybe a few viewers add great points that I would\nwant to highlight in the video as an addendum, etc.\nThis also affects educational videos the most: Instead of updating the video\nwhen a programming library API changes, I would need to upload an entirely new\nvideo.\nThe Alternatives To YouTube\nAlternatives to YouTube, that can mitigate some disadvantages, exist in\nthe form of streaming and blogging.\nStreaming\nI already briefly mentioned streaming. While it doesn't really scratch the creative\nitch, it also doesn't take any extra time to do. When I streamed earlier this\nyear, I did it while programming on my game. It didn't take long to have my\nfirst regulars, with whom I talked about our shared interests. Whenever I got a\nnew follower, I used that opportunity to ask them about their projects, which\noften resulted in some nice conversations.\nThe option to return to streaming has opened up again, but currently, I feel not\nsure anymore. Getting into the zone seems impossible while streaming. Talking\nthrough the current work at hand on didn't distract me directly, as I typically\njust verbalized my inner thoughts. Unfortunately, smaller distractions, like\nglancing at the chat or thoughts about the stream itself, asking myself if my\ncurrent work bores viewers, created enough interruptions to keep me from losing\nmyself in my work. The live aspect surely didn't help, because I focused on not\ndoing anything weird, like picking my nose, browsing social media, turning on a\ncartoon, leaking anything too private or flashing my bum live on stream.\nHaving barely any experience with streaming contributed probably to this a lot,\nand routine and familiarity might avoid this somewhat.\nBlogging\nHonestly, blogging didn't cross my mind at all at first. Blogging as a whole\nseems not nearly as popular anymore, compared to 10-20 years ago.\nWhen I visited r/NewTubers, to read\nup on the whole How-To YouTube stuff, one post in particular stood out to me:\nYouTube isn't the only\nway,\nby Chris Zukowski, who has one of the most popular game development blogs: How\nTo Market A Game, where he talks about the\nmarketing side of indie game development.\nWhile he aims his advice towards people who struggled with YouTube for years,\nencouraging them to give blogging a try, it got me thinking: My reasons\nfor doing YouTube also apply to a classic blog. Blogs also don't have any of the\nmentioned drawbacks, unless I pick any of the proprietary blogging platforms.\nAt first, I thought that the debate would shift to video vs. text content, but I\ndon't think that this makes a lot of sense. I can just pick the medium that fits\nbest and just self-host it on my blog. I can easily embed a video on my website,\nif I really wanted to, if it fits the content I want to create.\nHaving \"plain text\" as a viable option opens up many advantages. Since text\nworks nicely with version control systems, preservation becomes really simple.\nUpdating and storing text files requires minimal effort, and they offer greater\nportability, allowing me to create them almost anywhere. I can sit down and\nwrite without dressing up, anywhere where I want, even in a noisy environment.\nI appreciate this flexibility, given that my little 25-years old buddy can make\na lot of noise.\n\nAnother advantage comes from the fact that only a small part of game developers\nseem to blog. While a large part of the audience moved towards video content, I\nreckon that the demand for written articles still exists. In fact, I prefer\nconsuming written content over videos, as it allows for easier skimming,\nextracting and copying of relevant information.\nYouTube vs Blogging\nI established that I want to log, but should I do YouTube or traditional\nblogging? Maybe even a hybrid approach to get the best of both worlds?\nYouTube offers reach, and the ability to bring organic traffic through the\nalgorithm.\nBlogs kinda sit on the opposite end and have basically almost no\ndiscoverability. Readers have to go out of their way to actively seek out the\ncontent. No \"front page\" or recommendations will guide them to me.\nWell, unless I write on a third party blogging platform, but YouTube would still\nhave orders of magnitudes more viewers.\nI mentioned that a large follower count does not matter to me, but writing posts\nthat no one will read, nullifies some of my goals. A blog requires some\nextra effort to bring new readers to it, for example by using other social\nmedia, including YouTube. Many bloggers go for a hybrid approach, where they\npublish supplementary YouTube videos for their blog posts.\nText also feels less personal compared to a video because personality often\ntakes center stage on YouTube, especially in vlogs. While this dynamic does not\ninherently create a problem, a less personal approach offers an added layer of\nprotection, not just in real-life, but also for my mental health. I can detach\nmyself from criticism of my content, but receiving judgments about personal\ntraits, such as appearance, voice, or style could impact my mental well-being,\nespecially when it just piles up. This also creates a bias towards\nagreeableness. A contrarian opinion can often cause heated arguments, where\npeople become quick to throw around ad hominems. This can still happen on a\nblog, especially when it allows users to comment, but to a much lesser extent.\nWith a blog, I also maintain the freedom to just nuke everything and start fresh\nwithout leaving a trace to my previous attempts, while it takes only a single\nviewer of my failed vlog to expose my previous identity. I don't plan on doing\nthis, but it feels reassuring that this nuclear option exists. I can just voice\nwhat comes to my mind, and if the heat gets too much, I can \"reset\" it.\nThis allows YouTubers to create a more personal connection with their audience,\neven if it remains mainly a one-sided, parasocial one. This comes with\ntrade-offs: The audience often demonstrates strong loyalty and a willingness to\ngo out of their way to support their favorite creators, some even going so far\nthat it might share the same characteristics of a little cult. It also means\nthat it doesn't take much to turn their feelings into something destructive,\nbecause they take this relationship too seriously. This dynamic can not only\ncause the cultivation of yes-men who will create echo chambers and can lead to\npoor decision making, but also can cause all kinds of drama. You can often see\nsomeone disagreeing with the content creators point in the comments, providing a\nvalid and constructive argument, just to get buried in a stream of followers\njumping in to \"defend\" their favorite YouTuber.\nAs mentioned in the beginning, YouTube comes with a flexibility, that allows it\nto take any desired shape. Nothing would prevent me from hiding my face, and use\nAI voices. The possibility for text-only videos exists as well. In that case, I\ndon't see any value over a traditional blog, though.\nThe final consideration lies in the enjoyment of the content creation for the\nchosen medium. Do I enjoy writing or video editing? Thinking about that 17-hours\nin the making video, I can confidently say that while I enjoy thinking about\ntitles and creating thumbnails, I loath actual video editing. I also kept\nputting off recording as well, because it feels like a drag. Setting up the lights,\ntrying to set up an environment where I can record without any distractions,\npotentially take a fresh shower to not look like a mess, and all the other\nthings, become just hurdles.\nConclusion\nI would like to conclude this post with a thought experiment: Let's imagine I\nwould beat the odds and my games became successful. Would I still want to share\nmy progress and thoughts? I can confidently say that I would, just to still my\nurge to share my stuff and sort out my thoughts.\nThinking about an alternative timeline where my games fail, but the devlogs\nfor either medium gained traction, and with that I mean something like 10k\nfollowers, or netting me $1000 a month, would I still ask myself if I wanted to\ndo the other medium?\nIf I did YouTube and it gained traction, I would definitely say yes, I would\nstill think about blogging. Partly because of the ownership reasons, so my blog\ncould grow slowly over time, but also because the low barrier for creating and\nupdating posts. Even with a successful YouTube I would probably refer to a blog\npost to share my sales data, because I could constantly update it when desired.\nWith a successful Blog, I don't think I would care about YouTube at all, aside\nfrom a handy way to upload and share videos files that I would embed into my\nblog, or trailers for my game. But I might as well self-host them, or use any\nother hosting platform. Using YouTube for vlogs, would just create extra work,\nfor no benefits.\nFollowing this line of thought makes me realize that the things that make me\ngravitate towards YouTube fall purely into external motivators, like \"fame\" and\nmoney, not the creation of the content itself. As it stands, I feel like I enjoy\nthe idea of becoming a YouTuber, but not the actual craft.\nTurns out that no compelling reasons push me to use YouTube, as a simple blog\ncan achieve the same goals, while offering some advantages. Owning the platform\nfully, avoiding the trap of status-seeking, and maintaining complete flexibility\nand independence, provide strong incentives.\n","description":"YouTube as a game developer feels like a trap.
